## Why this tangent?

A news story regarding the 2023 Prague shootings caught my attention today. A lot was said and written, police response
was investigated. I’m no expert, and all I can offer are condolences and visions. This is one such vision.

Sci-fi?  
I don't think so.

## Action

Operator Log: “Seventy-Eight Seconds”

An alarm interrupts my thoughts.  
There’s a severe incident somewhere nearby.  
I jump from my chair—controller, goggles. The drone’s already in the air, waiting for me.

The last thing I read before the goggles go on:  
**Kotva shopping arcade. Active shooting.**

Everything else fades away.  
It’s just two blocks—piece of cake, I tell myself.  
Breathe in, breathe out. We drill this every week. Don’t lose your nerve.

I’m in place in thirty seconds. Could be faster, but the tram power lines are a distraction. Still, a good time.  
I see panicked crowds spilling out of the building. I tune them out; my goal is clear. Above their heads, I enter the building.

“Second or third floor,” my external surveillance team leader relays.  
Up the escalators we go.  
Second floor—clear.

A loud bang, another. I jump. Is it a shotgun?  
No time to think.

“No visuals yet, I’m taking the third floor!” I report.  
I mark the second-floor escalator for the autonomous drones as I push up.  
*Fifty-five seconds. What took me so long?*

Another bang—there’s the flash.  
“Third floor, northeast of the escalators!” I radio in, trying to stay matter-of-fact.  
I guide the drone toward the flashes.  
*Seventy seconds. Feels like forever.*

I see him. *This is real,* a part of me is yelling. No time to panic.

I hit the button.  
“Attacker on the third floor, cosmetics department!”  
A loud voice booms through the building. Good job, guys! I didn’t even know this floor’s layout.

Three more drones zip past to assist. I hold position, let the others catch up. The attacker is surrounded. From here on, none of his movements go unobserved.

*Seventy-three seconds.*  
He fires—three times to the right. Probably at people running. I force myself to stay focused on him.

“This is the police. We have you surrounded!”
Another speaker blares—right at the gunman. He turns, fires. Shotgun blast. The speaker drone shatters, raining plastic.

Suddenly, a panicked group appears in my feed. Damn. The autonomous drones haven’t marked safe zones yet. The gunman swings his weapon toward them. I don’t hesitate.

“Going in!”
I pull back, gain speed, and drive straight at him. He doesn’t have time to react.

Impact.
*Seventy-eight seconds.*
The timer flashes among the static of a dead video feed.

## Retrospection

There's an immediate mandatory retrospection meeting right after every incident. Drill or real.

The meeting room smells like burnt coffee and cold pizza. We sit in a loose circle, still wired from adrenaline and what-ifs.  
The atmosphere is dense, sombre. People died today.

The team leader goes around.  
“How’d it feel out there, first-timer?”

I shrug, trying to control the shakes.  
“It felt… automatic, honestly. All those drills—I knew exactly where to send the drone, even before the command finished talking.”  
People nod. We all know the feeling.

Another operator chimes in, “Good job there, you did well.”

I sigh.  
“It’s weird, but it didn’t really hit me until after. In the moment, it’s just… do what you practiced. Trust the routine. Get there fast.”

The team leader leans back.  
“That’s what makes the difference. Practice is what saves lives. Not gadgets, not luck—drills and teamwork.”

I look at my hands, still shaking.  
Today, the drill paid off.
