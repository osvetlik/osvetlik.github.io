title: Why?
---

Why should I write when there are already enough resources? Why should I even try? Well, if just a single person finds
inspiration in what I have to say, my work has its meaning. And by staying silent, I feel like contributing to the
general misunderstanding, thus worsening an already difficult situation for us.

Being neurodivergent or ADHD (which acronym is wrong practically in every single letter) is not easy. We don't fit
predefined roles, we are unpredictable, it's hard to plan us or for us. We seem to be a burden. We don't meet society's
expectations. Are we broken?

You need discipline, you need to try harder, stop being lazy, why don't you use your numerous talents? Parents and
teachers have said that countless times.

ADHD is a catch-all diagnosis. Everybody wants to be ADHD nowadays, the experts say.

Not helping, say I. That's why. Now I need to decide on "what" and "how". Being ADHD, it's not an easy task. But I'll
try.
